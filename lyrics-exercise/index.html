                    Why you standin' all by yourself?<br>
                    Those shoes were made for dancin' with someone else<br>
                    Why don't we move over to that empty space?<br>

                    Well, it's too soon to give up on tonight, oh<br>
                    I haven't had the chance to show you my moves and I<br>

                    Made for two<br>
                    Won't you show me just what you can do?<br>
