                <b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b><br>
                I've been studying computer science for a few years now and have gained experience through two software engineering internships. I enrolled in this class to further develop my knowledge of web development and to gain hands-on practice creating interactive websites, with the goal of becoming a stronger full-stack developer.

                <b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b><br>
                I have some experience with HTML and CSS from personal projects + other classes and have a basic understanding of JavaScript, but I wouldn't say that I'm very proficient in any of them.

                <b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b><br>
                I hope to learn more about JavaScript to make more interactive and dynamic web pages.

                <b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b><br>
                I expect designing for screen to be more interactive in the sense that users can click on different elements to navigate through websites, whereas designing for paper is more static and linear.

                <b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                I think <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> exemplifies effective design because of its clean layout, intuitive navigation, and high-quality yet minimalistic visuals.

            <li>
                <b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                I think <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas">Canvas</a> exemplifies effective communication because it presents information in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for users to navigate and find the resources they need.

                <b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                I think <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> works well because all of its pages (pre-login) maintain a clean, modern design that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate. The pages avoid overwhelming users with text and instead use graphics effectively to explain features and functionality. Together, these elements make GitHub a great example of a website that exemplifies both effective design and communication.
